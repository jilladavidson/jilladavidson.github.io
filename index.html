      <p class="quote">"Jill worked with us for many years before moving back to her home territory, when she was greatly missed. We were delighted when she decided to offer locum cover and have already made use of her excellent services. Jill is a safe pair of hands, with extensive experience so that nothing clinically, surgically or client-wise fazes her. Patients and clients love her and sheâ€™s adaptable and willing to fit in with practice protocols."</p>
